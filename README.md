### Metrices

In Scrappy I have used Two Matrices which is Sonarcloud and Codacy. 

SonarCloud is a cloud service offered by SonarSource and based on SonarQube. SonarQube is a widely adopted open source platform to inspect continuously the quality of source code and detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in more than 20 different languages.
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/your_domain

Codacy Automatically identify issues through static code review analysis. Therefore we can be notified on security issues, code coverage, code duplication, and code complexity in every commit and pull request, directly from your current workflow

### IDE

PhpStorm is a commercial, cross-platform IDE (integrated development environment) for PHP, built by the Czech Republic-based company JetBrains.

PhpStorm provides an editor for PHP, HTML and JavaScript with on-the-fly code analysis, error prevention and automated refactorings for PHP and JavaScript code. PhpStorm's code completion supports PHP 5.3- 7.4 (modern and legacy projects), including generators, coroutines, the finally keyword, list in foreach, namespaces, closures, traits and short array syntax. It includes a full-fledged SQL editor with editable query results.

PhpStorm has keyboard shortcuts for most of its commands related to editing, navigation, refactoring, debugging, and other tasks. Here are some of my favorite shortcuts.

•	Ctrl+ E - toggle between recently used files
•	Ctrl + / - comment/uncomment a block of code
•	Ctrl + B - go to the class declaration
•	Ctrl + R - search and replace
•	Ctrl +Alt + L - reformat code
•	Alt + Enter - show intention actions and quick-fixes


### DSL

Example:
Focusing on transaction searching that was both easy to read and deep enough to perform complicated queries. Such as;

•	Queried for exact match, no match, beginning of string, end of string and substring
•	Queried with a set of predefined values and will return all records matching any of the given values
•	Queried with a lower bound, an upper bound or both.

**Criteria**
Assume that user wants to search for transactions meeting the following criteria:
•	The order id starts with “a2d”
•	The customer website ends with “.com”
•	The billing first name equals “John”
•	The status is either Authorized or Settled
•	The amount is between 10 and 20 dollars
